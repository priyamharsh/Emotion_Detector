# Emotion_Detector
A CNN model is trained on faces which depict 7 different emotions:
`'angry', 'disgust', 'fear', 'happy', 'neutral', 'sad', 'surprise'`
The dataset can be downloaded from [kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013).
A script using OpenCV and the pretrained model helps tho predict emotion of the user based on facial expression seen from the webcam.
